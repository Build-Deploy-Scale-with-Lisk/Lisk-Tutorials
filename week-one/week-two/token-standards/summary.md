Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) token standards define rules for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These standards ensure compatibility and interoperability across the Ethereum ecosystem. The most prevalent ERC token standards are ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, each serving distinct purposes:

**ERC-20: Fungible Token Standard**

Introduced in 2015 and integrated into Ethereum in 2017, ERC-20 defines a standard for creating fungible tokensâ€”tokens that are identical and interchangeable. This standard is widely used for cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins. Key characteristics include:

- **Fungibility**: Each token is identical in type and value.

- **Divisibility**: Tokens can be divided into smaller units.

- **Interoperability**: ERC-20 tokens can be easily integrated with various wallets and exchanges.

Common use cases include representing financial assets like shares, dividends, fiat currencies, and commodities such as gold. 

**ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard**

Proposed in 2017 and accepted in 2018, ERC-721 is the standard for creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique and not interchangeable. Each token has distinct properties and ownership, making them suitable for representing unique digital assets. Key characteristics include:

- **Uniqueness**: Each token is distinct with unique metadata.

- **Indivisibility**: Tokens cannot be divided; they exist as whole units.

- **Provenance**: Ownership and history of each token can be tracked and verified.

Common use cases include digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and domain names. 

**ERC-1155: Multi-Token Standard**

Introduced in 2018 by Witek Radomski, ERC-1155 is a versatile standard that supports the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This flexibility reduces complexity and gas fees, especially beneficial in gaming and digital art platforms. Key characteristics include:

- **Multi-Token Support**: Enables creation of multiple token types within a single contract.

- **Batch Transfers**: Allows multiple tokens to be transferred in a single transaction, improving efficiency.

- **Flexibility**: Supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, catering to a wide range of applications.

Common use cases include gaming assets, digital art, and supply chain management. 

Understanding these token standards is crucial for developers and businesses looking to leverage Ethereum's capabilities for various applications, from creating new cryptocurrencies to developing complex digital ecosystems.
