# Onboarding Web2 Users and Developers to Web3: Understanding ERC-721 Tokens

## Introduction to ERC-721 Token Standard
Unlike ERC-20, ERC-721 is the token standard used to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are cryptographic tokens that are unique in nature and don’t share value with any other token similar to them. This means NFTs carry a unique value, like the painting of the Mona Lisa or other artwork that isn’t mass-produced. 

ERC-721 tokens enable developers to create digital assets that are distinct and represent ownership or proof of authenticity. They are widely used in applications such as digital art, gaming, and event ticketing.

## Key Features of ERC-721 Tokens

### Non-Fungibility
Each ERC-721 token is unique and cannot be exchanged one-for-one with another. This makes them ideal for representing rare or unique assets.

### Examples of ERC-721 Applications
- **CryptoKitties:** A popular application where each digital cat is unique and valued differently.
- **Beeple’s Artwork:** Sold for $69.3 million, showcasing the value of digital ownership.
- **Decentraland:** Virtual real estate and collectibles.

## Functions Defined by the ERC-721 Standard
An ERC-721 smart contract includes the following key functions:

1. **`balanceOf(address owner)`**: Returns the number of tokens owned by a specific address.
2. **`ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`**: Identifies the owner of a specific token by its ID.
3. **`safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Safely transfers tokens from one address to another.
4. **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Transfers tokens without safety checks; generally not recommended.
5. **`approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Approves another address to transfer a specific token.
6. **`setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`**: Grants or revokes permission for an operator to manage all of the owner’s tokens.
7. **`getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`**: Retrieves the approved address for a specific token.
8. **`isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`**: Checks if an operator has permission to manage all of the owner’s tokens.

## Events in ERC-721 Tokens

- **`Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`**: Triggered when ownership of an NFT changes.
- **`Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)`**: Triggered when an address is approved to transfer a token.

## Extensions of ERC-721
### ERC721Enumerable
Adds methods for enumerating NFTs:
- **`totalSupply()`**: Total number of tokens in the contract.
- **`tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index)`**: Token ID owned by an address at a specific index.
- **`tokenByIndex(uint256 index)`**: Token ID at a given index in the total list of tokens.

### ERC721A
Optimized for batch minting of NFTs, reducing transaction costs:
- **`_mint(address to, uint256 quantity)`**: Mints multiple tokens in a single transaction.
- **`_safeMint(address to, uint256 quantity, bytes data)`**: Similar to `_mint` but includes a data parameter for additional context.

## Fungible vs Non-Fungible Tokens
### Fungible Tokens
Fungible tokens are interchangeable and divisible. Examples include ERC-20 tokens like USDT or DAI, where any unit is identical to another.

### Non-Fungible Tokens
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique and cannot be replaced or exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Examples include digital artwork, rare collectibles, and event tickets.

## Conclusion
ERC-721 provides the foundation for creating and managing unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging this standard, developers can build applications that introduce scarcity, authenticity, and ownership to digital ecosystems. NFTs have already disrupted industries like art, gaming, and real estate, opening up endless possibilities for innovation in the Web3 space.
