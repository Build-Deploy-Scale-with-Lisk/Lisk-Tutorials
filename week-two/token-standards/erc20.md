# Onboarding Web2 Users and Developers to Web3: Understanding ERC-20 Tokens

## Introduction to ERC-20 Token Standard
The ERC-20 standard is the fundamental framework for building fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Fungible tokens are interchangeable and hold equal value to one another. For example, just as a $10 bill in person A’s pocket is worth the same as a $10 bill in person B’s pocket, 10 ETH holds the same value as another 10 ETH.

ERC-20 tokens are highly versatile and widely used, enabling developers to create custom token utilities such as granting voting rights, rewarding network participants, and facilitating on-chain activities. Many well-known tokens, such as stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD), governance tokens (MKR, UNI), and utility tokens (BAT), are ERC-20 compliant.

## Key Features of ERC-20 Tokens

### Fungibility
All ERC-20 tokens are identical and interchangeable. This makes them suitable for applications requiring uniform tokens, such as digital currencies or voting systems.

### Examples
Popular ERC-20 tokens include:
- **USDT (Tether):** A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.
- **UNI:** The governance token for the Uniswap platform.
- **DAI:** A stablecoin collateralized by other cryptocurrencies.

Many projects use ERC-20 tokens during their fundraising periods, known as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). ERC-20 tokens are also widely traded on exchanges, making them a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## Functions Defined by the ERC-20 Standard
An ERC-20 smart contract must implement the following functions to ensure compliance:

1. **`totalSupply()`**: Returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.
2. **`balanceOf(address account)`**: Returns the number of tokens owned by a specific address.
3. **`transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`**: Transfers tokens from the caller’s account to another account.
4. **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`**: Transfers tokens from one account to another on behalf of the owner.
5. **`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`**: Sets an allowance for another account to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
6. **`allowance(address owner, address spender)`**: Returns the remaining number of tokens a spender is allowed to spend from the owner’s account.

## Optional Functions
To enhance usability, the following optional functions can also be implemented:
- **`name()`**: Returns the token’s name.
- **`symbol()`**: Returns the token’s ticker symbol.
- **`decimals()`**: Specifies the number of decimal places the token uses.

## Events in ERC-20 Tokens
ERC-20 tokens also define two key events:
1. **`Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)`**: Triggered when tokens are transferred.
2. **`Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)`**: Triggered on successful calls to the `approve()` method.

## Benefits of the ERC-20 Standard
1. **Interoperability**: Ensures that tokens can interact seamlessly with wallets, dApps, and exchanges.
2. **Security**: The standard’s widespread adoption has led to rigorous testing, reducing vulnerabilities.
3. **Efficiency**: Developers can build applications faster by leveraging a well-defined framework.
4. **Transparency**: Clear rules foster trust among users and developers.

## Conclusion
ERC-20 is the most widely used token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. Its robust framework enables the creation of fungible tokens for various use cases, from digital currencies to governance mechanisms. By adhering to this standard, developers can ensure that their tokens are secure, interoperable, and compatible across platforms, fostering innovation and adoption in the Web3 ecosystem.
