**Follow These Instructions for Setting Up Hardhat and Foundry**  

To set up your development environment for Hardhat and Foundry, refer to our step-by-step guide:  
[Hardhat and Foundry Setup Instructions](https://github.com/Build-Deploy-Scale-with-Lisk/Lisk-Tutorials/tree/main/week-one/hardhat-and-foundry).  

### **Important Note**  
Ensure you install OpenZeppelin contracts, as they are essential for compiling and deploying your token contracts successfully. Failing to do so will result in compilation errors.  

- **For Hardhat:**  
  Run the following command to install OpenZeppelin contracts:  
  ```bash
  npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
  ```  

- **For Foundry:**  
  Use this command to install OpenZeppelin contracts:  
  ```bash
  forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
  ```  

### **Use Our Boilerplate Projects**  
To save time and streamline your workflow, feel free to use our pre-configured projects as boilerplates for deploying your tokens:  
- **Hardhat Boilerplate:**

By following these steps, using the boilerplates, and ensuring the proper setup, youâ€™ll compile and deploy your token contracts successfully.
